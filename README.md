This is a sample app to exercise the a channel browsing system 
The app is template based.  The main view is a tableview, where each section is representative of a channel.  Each section has a single row which will show all the current videos associated with that channel using a collectionview.  The row is horizontally scrolling.  Each channel may contain subcategories and each subcategories may contain other subcategories. At the end of each channel's video list, a "See More" button will appear to allow the user to drill down further into that channel lineup.  This type of follow through is repeated for each subcategory ad infinitim.
